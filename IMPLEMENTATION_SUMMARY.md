---

## üéØ Project Overview

Successfully implemented a complete ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) Error Reporting System consisting of 5 microservices, each following Hexagonal Architecture principles and developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Summary

### Hexagonal Architecture Implementation
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic with entities, value objects, and domain services
- **Application Layer**: Use cases, DTOs, and port interfaces
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Adapters for databases, HTTP, messaging, and external services
- **Ports & Adapters**: Clear separation between business logic and external concerns

### SOLID Principles Applied
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes are substitutable for their base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on interfaces they use
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
