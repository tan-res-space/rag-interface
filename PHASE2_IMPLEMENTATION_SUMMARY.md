- **Alembic Configuration** (`src/shared/infrastructure/database/migrations/`)
  - Complete Alembic setup
  - Initial schema migration
  - Environment configuration
  - Template files

### 6. Service-to-Service Communication
- **Base HTTP Client** (`src/shared/infrastructure/http_client/base_client.py`)
  - Async HTTP operations with httpx
  - Automatic retries with exponential backoff
  - Authentication support
  - Health check functionality
  
- **RAG Integration Client** (`src/shared/infrastructure/http_client/rag_integration_client.py`)
  - Specialized client for RAG operations
  - Embedding generation and similarity search
  - Model and storage information retrieval
  
- **Error Reporting Client** (`src/shared/infrastructure/http_client/error_reporting_client.py`)
  - Specialized client for error reporting
  - CRUD operations for error reports
  - Analytics and performance metrics
  
- **Service Registry** (`src/shared/infrastructure/http_client/service_registry.py`)
  - Central service discovery
  - Client lifecycle management
  - Environment-based configuration
  - Health monitoring for all services

## üîß Updated Components

### RAG Integration Service Controllers
- Updated to use real ML adapters instead of mock responses
- Proper error handling and logging
- Integration with dependency injection system

### Error Reporting Service
- Added dependency injection initialization
- Proper service lifecycle management
- Database adapter factory integration

## üß™ Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Test File**: `test_phase2_functionality.py`
- **Coverage**: All 8 major components tested
- **Results**: 8/8 tests passed ‚úÖ

### Test Categories
1. **Import Tests**: Verify all modules can be imported
2. **Factory Tests**: Verify factory patterns work correctly
3. **Functionality Tests**: Verify actual operations work
4. **Integration Tests**: Verify components work together

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements

### Hexagonal Architecture Compliance
- Clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- Port and adapter pattern implementation
- Dependency inversion principle adherence

### Dependency Management
- Optional dependencies for database adapters
- Graceful degradation when dependencies are missing
- Clear error messages for missing packages

### Service Communication
- Standardized HTTP client patterns
- Centralized service discovery
- Consistent authentication handling

## üì¶ Dependencies

### Required Packages
- `httpx`: HTTP client for service communication
- `tenacity`: Retry logic with exponential backoff
- `alembic`: Database migrations
- `sqlalchemy`: ORM and database abstraction

### Optional Packages
- `pymongo` + `motor`: MongoDB support
- `aioodbc`: SQL Server support
- `openai`: OpenAI API integration

## üöÄ Next Steps

Phase 2 provides a solid foundation for:
1. **Phase 3**: Advanced RAG features and optimization
2. **Phase 4**: Production deployment and monitoring
3. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end system testing
4. **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing

## üìù Notes

- All components follow async/await patterns for scalability
- Proper logging and error handling throughout
- Environment-based configuration for flexibility
- Thread-safe operations where applicable
- Comprehensive documentation and type hints

The Phase 2 implementation successfully establishes the core infrastructure needed for a production-ready RAG Interface system.
