## Overview

This document summarizes all documentation updates completed in Phase 1 for transitioning the RAG Interface project from a progression-based bucket system to a quality-based speaker bucket management system with enhanced metadata capture and verification workflows.

---

## Key Requirements Changes Implemented

### 1. Bucket System Transformation
**From:** Progression-based system (🌱 Beginner → 🌿 Intermediate → 🌳 Advanced → 🏆 Expert)  
**To:** Quality-based system (🛠️ High Touch → ⚙️ Medium Touch → 🔧 Low Touch → 🎯 No Touch)

**Business Logic Change:**
- **Previous**: Speakers progress through levels based on performance improvement
- **New**: Speakers are categorized based on ASR draft quality and MT effort required

### 2. Enhanced Metadata Requirements
**New Required Fields:**
- Number of speakers (one, two, three, four, five)
- Overlapping speech (yes, no)
- Requires specialized knowledge (yes, no)
- Additional notes (free text, max 1000 characters)

**Existing Fields Maintained:**
- Speaker ID, Client ID, Bucket Type
- Audio quality, Speaker clarity, Background noise

### 3. New Functional Requirements
- **Speaker History Tracking**: Complete error history and performance monitoring
- **Verification Workflow**: Integration with InstaNote Database for error rectification verification
- **RAG-Based Corrections**: Automatic application of corrections to subsequent drafts
- **Copy-Paste Restrictions**: Security measures to prevent draft text copying
