# Architectural Alignment Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This report outlines the findings of an architectural alignment audit comparing the Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) Error Reporting Product Requirements Document (PRD) against the detailed architecture, and the high-level architecture against the detailed component designs.

The audit has revealed several critical discrepancies between the documented requirements, high-level design principles, and the detailed implementation plans. These issues span missing features, incomplete implementations, unaddressed non-functional requirements, and contradictions in core architectural strategies.

**Overall Alignment Status: Significant Misalignments Found**

Immediate action is required to address these gaps. Failure to do so will likely result in a product that does not meet user expectations, violates core architectural principles, and incurs significant rework costs. The following sections provide a detailed breakdown of each issue and recommended actions to realign the project.

## Actionable Misalignments

| ID | Location(s) of Issue | Source of Truth Reference | Description of Misalignment | Impact/Risk | Recommended Action | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PRD-01** | Error Reporting Service | [`documents/ASR_Error_Reporting_PRD.md:260`](documents/ASR_Error_Reporting_PRD.md:260) | **Missing Feature - Custom Error Categorization:** The PRD requires users to define their own error categories. The current architecture hardcodes these categories, preventing user customization. | Lowers user satisfaction and flexibility; fails to meet a key product differentiator. | Redesign the Error Reporting Service to support dynamic, user-defined error categories stored in the database. | **High** |
| **PRD-02** | Frontend/UI Architecture | [`documents/ASR_Error_Reporting_PRD.md:234`](documents/ASR_Error_Reporting_PRD.md:234) | **Incomplete Implementation - Non-Contiguous Text Selection:** The PRD specifies that users must be able to select multiple, non-contiguous text segments for a single error report. The architecture only supports a single, contiguous block. | Degrades user experience for complex error reporting scenarios; fails to meet core functional requirement. | Revise the frontend architecture and data model to support multi-segment selections. | **High** |
| **PRD-03** | System-Wide (Client-Side) | [`documents/ASR_Error_Reporting_PRD.md:422`](documents/ASR_Error_Reporting_PRD.md:422) | **Unaddressed NFR - Offline Support:** The PRD requires that users can save error report drafts locally during network interruptions. This critical non-functional requirement is not addressed in the design. | Risk of data loss for users in unstable network conditions, leading to frustration and reduced trust. | Implement a client-side storage mechanism (e.g., IndexedDB) to save drafts locally and sync upon reconnection. | **Medium** |
| **PRD-04** | Error Reporting Service | [`documents/ASR_Error_Reporting_PRD.md:971`](documents/ASR_Error_Reporting_PRD.md:971) | **Mismatched Performance Target - Error Submission:** The PRD specifies a performance target of `< 2s` for error submission, while the master architecture summary aims for a stricter `< 1s`. | Ambiguity in performance goals can lead to incorrect engineering trade-offs and unmet expectations. | Clarify the definitive performance target with stakeholders and update all documentation to reflect the agreed-upon metric. | **Low** |
| **PRD-05** | API Gateway / All Services | [`documents/ASR_Error_Reporting_PRD.md:1103`](documents/ASR_Error_Reporting_PRD.md:1103) | **API Versioning Discrepancy:** The PRD defines a `/v1/` versioning scheme for all APIs, which is completely missing from the detailed service designs. | Lack of versioning will make future API evolution difficult and increases the risk of breaking changes for clients. | Mandate the inclusion of the `/v1/` path prefix in all API endpoints across all service designs. | **Medium** |
| **ARCH-01** | High-Level vs. Detailed Architecture | `documents/ASR_System_Architecture_Design.md` vs. `documents/detailed_architecture/01_Error_Reporting_Service_Design.md` | **Missing Adapters in High-Level Design:** The detailed Error Reporting Service design includes a `Cache Adapter` and an `Auth Adapter` that are not represented in the high-level system architecture diagram. | The high-level design is an inaccurate and incomplete representation, potentially misleading architects and new team members about service dependencies. | Update the high-level architecture diagram to include the `Cache` and `Auth` adapters as explicit components. | **Medium** |
| **ARCH-02** | High-Level vs. Detailed Architecture | `documents/ASR_System_Architecture_Design.md` vs. `documents/detailed_architecture/` | **Introduction of Synchronous Communication:** Detailed designs introduce synchronous REST calls between services, directly contradicting the high-level architecture's stated principle of being event-driven and asynchronous. | Violates core architectural principles, risking tight coupling between services and reducing system resilience and scalability. | Re-evaluate each synchronous call. Justify its use or refactor to an asynchronous, event-based pattern. Update the high-level principles if synchronous communication is deemed acceptable. | **High** |
| **ARCH-03**| High-Level vs. Detailed Architecture | `documents/ASR_System_Architecture_Design.md` vs. `documents/detailed_architecture/` | **Unspecified WebSocket Communication:** Detailed designs specify the use of WebSockets for real-time client communication, a pattern not mentioned or approved in the high-level architecture. | Introduces a significant, unvetted technology and communication pattern, impacting infrastructure, security, and scalability plans. | Formally document the requirement for real-time updates and update the high-level architecture to include WebSockets as an approved communication pattern. | **Medium** |
| **ARCH-04** | High-Level vs. Detailed Architecture | `documents/ASR_System_Architecture_Design.md` vs. `documents/detailed_architecture/02_RAG_Integration_Service_Design.md` | **Additional Vector Database Option:** The detailed RAG service design includes "Qdrant" as a potential vector database, which is not in the approved high-level tech stack of "Pinecone/Weaviate". | Creates ambiguity in the tech stack and could lead to unapproved technologies being used, affecting licensing, support, and operational consistency. | Either remove "Qdrant" from the detailed design or initiate a formal review process to have it approved as part of the official tech stack. | **Low** |
