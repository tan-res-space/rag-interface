# Speaker Bucket Management System Architecture

## Overview

The Speaker Bucket Management System is a comprehensive platform designed to categorize speakers based on their speech recognition quality and facilitate continuous improvement through AI-powered corrections and medical transcriptionist validation. The system follows hexagonal architecture principles with clear separation of concerns and domain-driven design.

## Architecture Principles

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
- **Domain Core**: Business logic isolated from external concerns
- **Ports**: Interfaces defining how the domain interacts with external systems
- **Adapters**: Implementations that connect ports to specific technologies
- **Dependency Inversion**: Dependencies point inward toward the domain

### Domain-Driven Design
- **Bounded Contexts**: Clear boundaries between different business domains
- **Aggregates**: Consistency boundaries for related entities
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects representing domain concepts
- **Domain Services**: Business logic that doesn't belong to specific entities

### Microservices Architecture
- **Service Autonomy**: Each service owns its data and business logic
- **Technology Diversity**: Services can use different technologies as appropriate
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed independently
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don't cascade to others
