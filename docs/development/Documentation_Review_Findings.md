## üî¥ **HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES**

### **Issue #1: Implementation vs Documentation Gap**
**Location**: Source code vs. Architecture documents  
**Description**: Only 2 of 5 documented services are implemented

| Service | Documentation Status | Implementation Status |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Error Reporting Service (ERS) | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Implemented |
| User Management Service (UMS) | ‚úÖ Complete | üü° Partial |
| RAG Integration Service (RIS) | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚ùå Missing |
| Correction Engine Service (CES) | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚ùå Missing |
| Verification Service (VS) | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚ùå Missing |

**Impact**: Critical functionality missing for core system operation  
**Recommendation**: Prioritize implementation of missing services or update documentation to reflect current scope  
**Priority**: **High**

### **Issue #2: Technology Stack Inconsistencies**
**Location**: Multiple documents  
**Description**: Conflicting technology specifications across documents

| Document | Technology Specification | Conflict |
|----------|-------------------------|----------|
| ASR_Error_Reporting_PRD.md:58 | "Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant" | Qdrant not in high-level design |
| ASR_System_Architecture_Design.md:801 | "Pinecone, Weaviate, or Qdrant" | Inconsistent with PRD |
| docs/README.md:108 | "PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL Server" | MongoDB not consistently mentioned |

**Impact**: Ambiguity in tech stack could lead to unapproved technologies being used  
**Recommendation**: Create single source of truth for approved technologies  
**Priority**: **High**

### **Issue #3: API Versioning Conflicts**
**Location**: API specifications across documents  
**Description**: PRD specifies `/api/v1/` versioning scheme, but detailed service designs omit versioning

**Examples:**
- **PRD Specification**: `POST /api/v1/errors/report`
- **Service Design**: `POST /errors/report`
- **Missing**: Version prefix in all detailed service API designs

**Impact**: Future API evolution will be difficult without proper versioning  
**Recommendation**: Mandate `/api/v1/` prefix in all service API designs  
**Priority**: **High**

### **Issue #4: Missing Core Functionality**
**Location**: ASR_Error_Reporting_PRD.md vs. Implementation  
**Description**: Several PRD requirements not addressed in architecture

| Requirement | PRD Reference | Status | Impact |
|-------------|---------------|--------|---------|
| Custom Error Categorization | Line 260 | ‚ùå Missing | User flexibility reduced |
| Non-Contiguous Text Selection | Line 234 | ‚ùå Missing | UX degradation |
| Offline Support | Line 422 | ‚ùå Missing | Data loss risk |

**Recommendation**: Redesign services to support missing functionality  
**Priority**: **High**

---

## üü° **MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES**

### **Issue #5: Performance Target Discrepancies**
**Location**: Multiple performance specifications  
**Description**: Conflicting performance requirements across documents

| Document | Metric | Target | Conflict |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| PRD (line 971) | Error submission | < 2 seconds | Different targets |
| Master Architecture (line 151) | Error submission | < 1 second | Different targets |
| ERS Design | Error validation | Sub-second | Unclear specification |

**Recommendation**: Clarify definitive performance targets with stakeholders  
**Priority**: **Medium**

### **Issue #6: Missing Mermaid Diagrams**
**Location**: Various documents  
**Description**: User preference for Mermaid diagrams not consistently applied

**Missing Diagrams:**
- `vector_db_data_model.md`: Contains only ERD, missing architecture diagrams
- Some detailed architecture documents lack workflow diagrams
- Sequence diagrams missing in several service designs

**Recommendation**: Add comprehensive Mermaid diagrams for architecture, workflows, and sequences  
**Priority**: **Medium**

### **Issue #7: Database Schema Inconsistencies**
**Location**: Data model specifications  
**Description**: Different database schemas across documents

| Document | Schema Complexity | Tables | Approach |
|----------|------------------|--------|----------|
| PRD ERD | Complex | 15+ tables | Full relational model |
| Vector DB Model | Simple | 4 tables | Minimal structure |
| Implementation | Varies | Unknown | Inconsistent |

**Recommendation**: Consolidate and standardize database schema across all documents  
**Priority**: **Medium**

---

## üü¢ **LOW PRIORITY ISSUES**

### **Issue #8: User Story Completeness**
**Location**: ASR_Error_Reporting_PRD.md user stories  
**Description**: Some user stories missing required elements

**Missing Elements:**
- Story points for some user stories (US-1.1, US-2.1)
- Inconsistent acceptance criteria formatting
- Missing story point estimates for some epics

**Recommendation**: Complete all user stories with proper acceptance criteria and story points  
**Priority**: **Low**

### **Issue #9: Documentation Version Control**
**Location**: Document headers  
**Description**: Inconsistent versioning and dating

**Issues:**
- Version numbers not consistently updated
- Date inconsistencies across related documents
- Some documents lack version control information

**Recommendation**: Implement consistent versioning scheme across all documents  
**Priority**: **Low**
