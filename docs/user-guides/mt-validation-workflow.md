   - **4 Stars**: Good corrections, noticeable improvement
   - **3 Stars**: Adequate corrections, some improvement
   - **2 Stars**: Poor corrections, minimal improvement
   - **1 Star**: Incorrect corrections, no improvement or degradation

2. **Improvement Assessment**
   - **Significant**: Major improvement in accuracy and readability
   - **Moderate**: Noticeable improvement with some remaining issues
   - **Minimal**: Small improvement, many issues remain
   - **None**: No meaningful improvement
   - **Negative**: Corrections made text worse

3. **Comments**
   - Provide specific feedback on correction quality
   - Note particularly good or problematic corrections
   - Suggest improvements for future processing
   - Highlight clinical accuracy concerns

4. **Bucket Recommendation**
   - Recommend bucket transition if speaker shows consistent improvement
   - Consider overall quality trend and correction effectiveness
   - Base recommendation on clinical accuracy and efficiency gains
