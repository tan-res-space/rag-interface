## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the detailed system architecture designs for the ASR Error Reporting System's five backend services. Each service has been designed following **Hexagonal Architecture principles** combined with **SOLID coding principles** and **Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology** to enable independent development, testing in isolation, clear separation between business logic and external dependencies, and maintainable, extensible code that adheres to industry best practices.

### SOLID Principles + TDD Integration

Every module in this system strictly follows the **SOLID principles** and **TDD methodology**:

**SOLID Principles:**
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class and module has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities are open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

**Test-Driven Development (TDD) Methodology:**
- **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**: All code follows the TDD cycle of writing failing tests, making them pass, then refactoring
- **Test-First Development**: Tests must be written before any production code
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Maintain 70% unit, 20% integration, 10% E2E test coverage
- **SOLID Validation**: Tests validate and enforce SOLID principle compliance
- **Continuous Refactoring**: Code is continuously improved while maintaining test coverage

These principles and methodology are seamlessly integrated with the Hexagonal Architecture pattern to create a robust, maintainable, and thoroughly tested system.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. Hexagonal Architecture + SOLID Principles Implementation

#### 1.1 Hexagonal Architecture Benefits
- **Clear Separation**: Business logic isolated from infrastructure concerns
- **Testability**: Easy mocking of dependencies for unit testing
- **Flexibility**: Simple to swap external dependencies without affecting core logic
- **Independent Development**: Teams can work in parallel with well-defined interfaces

#### 1.2 SOLID Principles + TDD Implementation

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Domain entities focus on business logic only
- Adapters handle only infrastructure concerns
- Use cases contain only application logic

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- Services are extensible through new adapters without modifying core logic
- New error categories can be added without changing existing validation logic
- ML models can be swapped through adapter interfaces
- New notification channels can be added via adapter pattern

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- All adapter implementations are fully substitutable
- Database adapters (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL Server) can be swapped seamlessly
- Vector database implementations (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant) are interchangeable
- Authentication providers can be substituted without breaking functionality

**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- Ports are designed with specific, focused interfaces
- Clients depend only on the methods they actually use
- Separate interfaces for reading vs. writing operations
- Granular interfaces for different aspects of functionality

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- High-level modules (domain logic) don't depend on low-level modules (infrastructure)
- Both depend on abstractions (ports/interfaces)
- Concrete implementations are injected at runtime
- Business logic is completely independent of external systems

**Test-Driven Development (TDD) Integration**
- **Red Phase**: Write failing tests that define desired behavior before any implementation
- **Green Phase**: Write minimal code to make tests pass, focusing on functionality over design
- **Refactor Phase**: Improve code design while maintaining all tests in passing state
- **Test-First Mandate**: No production code is written without a corresponding failing test
- **SOLID Validation**: Tests serve as living documentation of SOLID principle compliance
- **Continuous Integration**: All tests must pass before code can be merged or deployed

### 2. Technology Stack Standardization (SOLID + TDD Compliant)
- **Backend Framework**: Python + FastAPI for all services (consistent interfaces, testable design)
- **Database Strategy**: PostgreSQL/MongoDB/SQL Server for relational data, Vector DB for embeddings, Redis for caching (abstracted through repository patterns, fully mockable)
- **Event Streaming**: Kafka for asynchronous service communication (publisher/subscriber abstractions, test-friendly)
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0/OIDC with JWT tokens (authentication interface abstraction, easily mocked)
- **Containerization**: Docker with Kubernetes orchestration (deployment abstraction, testable in isolation)
- **Testing Framework**: pytest + pytest-asyncio + pytest-mock for comprehensive TDD support

### 3. Service Communication Patterns (SOLID-Aligned)
- **Synchronous**: REST APIs for direct service-to-service communication (interface-based contracts)
- **Asynchronous**: Event-driven architecture using Kafka for loose coupling (publisher/subscriber abstractions)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for live correction streaming (real-time communication interfaces)
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization and session management (cache abstraction layer)

All communication patterns follow the **Dependency Inversion Principle** by depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, enabling easy testing and technology substitution.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Implementation Guide

### 1. TDD Methodology Requirements

**Mandatory TDD Workflow:**
All development in the ASR Error Reporting System must follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. **Red Phase**: Write a failing test that defines the desired behavior
2. **Green Phase**: Write the minimal code necessary to make the test pass
3. **Refactor Phase**: Improve the code design while keeping all tests green

**Test-First Development Mandates:**
- No production code may be written without a corresponding failing test
- Tests must be written at the appropriate level (unit, integration, or E2E)
- All tests must pass before code can be committed to version control
- Code reviews must verify TDD compliance and test quality

### 2. TDD Integration with Hexagonal Architecture

**Testing Ports (Interfaces):**
```python
# Test the port interface contract
class TestErrorRepositoryPort:
    def test_save_returns_valid_id(self):
        # Red: Write failing test for port contract
        repository = MockErrorRepository()
        error_report = create_test_error_report()

        # Green: Implement minimal functionality
        error_id = repository.save(error_report)

        # Assert contract compliance
        assert error_id is not None
        assert isinstance(error_id, str)
        assert len(error_id) > 0
```

**Testing Core Domain Logic:**
```python
# Test business logic in isolation
class TestErrorReportDomain:
    def test_calculate_severity_for_critical_error(self):
        # Red: Write failing test for business rule
        error_report = ErrorReport(
            original_text="Hello world",
            corrected_text="Goodbye world",
            error_categories=[ErrorCategory.SUBSTITUTION]
        )

        # Green: Implement business logic
        severity = error_report.calculate_severity()

        # Assert business rule
        assert severity == SeverityLevel.HIGH
```

**Testing Adapters:**
```python
# Test adapter implementations
class TestPostgreSQLErrorRepository:
    def test_save_persists_to_database(self):
        # Red: Write failing test for adapter
        repository = PostgreSQLErrorRepository(test_db_connection)
        error_report = create_test_error_report()

        # Green: Implement adapter functionality
        error_id = repository.save(error_report)

        # Assert persistence
        saved_report = repository.get_by_id(error_id)
        assert saved_report.original_text == error_report.original_text
```

## SOLID Principles Implementation Guide

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Implementation

**Service Level:**
- Each microservice has a single, well-defined business responsibility
- Error Reporting Service: Only handles error submission and management
- RAG Integration Service: Only handles vector processing and ML operations
- Correction Engine Service: Only handles real-time correction application

**Class Level:**
- Domain entities contain only business logic and data
- Use cases contain only application workflow logic
- Adapters contain only infrastructure integration logic
- Controllers contain only HTTP request/response handling

**Example Structure:**
```
ErrorReportDomain (SRP: Business rules only)
ErrorReportUseCase (SRP: Application logic only)
ErrorReportController (SRP: HTTP handling only)
ErrorReportRepository (SRP: Data persistence only)
```

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP) Implementation

**Extension Points:**
- New error categories can be added without modifying existing validation logic
- New ML models can be integrated through adapter interfaces
- New notification channels can be added via publisher interfaces
- New authentication providers can be plugged in through auth interfaces

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Use abstract base classes for extensible components
- Implement strategy pattern for configurable behaviors
- Use factory pattern for creating extensible objects
- Leverage dependency injection for runtime configuration

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) Implementation

**Substitutable Components:**
- All database adapters (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL Server) are fully interchangeable
- Vector database implementations (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant) can be swapped
- Authentication providers (OAuth, SAML, JWT) are substitutable
- ML model implementations can be replaced without breaking functionality

**Contract Guarantees:**
- All implementations honor the same interface contracts
- Pre-conditions are not strengthened in derived classes
- Post-conditions are not weakened in derived classes
- Invariants are preserved across all implementations

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) Implementation

**Focused Interfaces:**
- Separate read and write repository interfaces
- Distinct interfaces for different aspects of functionality
- Client-specific interfaces rather than monolithic ones
- Granular port definitions for specific use cases

**Interface Examples:**
```
ErrorReaderPort (read-only operations)
ErrorWriterPort (write-only operations)
ErrorValidatorPort (validation-specific operations)
ErrorSearchPort (search-specific operations)
```

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) Implementation

**Abstraction Layers:**
- High-level modules (domain logic) depend only on abstractions
- Low-level modules (infrastructure) implement abstractions
- Dependency injection container manages concrete implementations
- Configuration-driven dependency resolution

**Implementation Benefits:**
- Business logic is completely testable in isolation
- Infrastructure components can be swapped without code changes
- Development teams can work independently on different layers
- System is resilient to external dependency changes
