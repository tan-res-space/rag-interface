This is a Value added service for the Medical Treanscription Quality Assurance (QA) team.

The transcription software works in two steps:
1. Transcription: The audio is transcribed into text called the ASR drafts. Done by an ASR model.
2. Post-Processing: The ASR draft is post-processed to correct errors and improve quality. Done by Medical Transcription Specialists (MTS).
3. QA: The post-processed text is reviewed by QA team and errors are corrected.

We have to plan for implementing the following use cases.
Steps:
1. QA noticing a specific error for a specific speaker in the ASR Draft.
2. QA selects and submits that error for better handling, target is to correct that error from next draft onwards.
3. QA submits the error and corresponding corrections into vector db along with relevant metadata for more targeted search.
4. From next draft onwards for that specific speaker the same error should be rectified.
5. QA should be provided a way to verify that the error is rectified in the next draft. 
    We have to pull the jobs for the same spekers from InstaNote Database and appy RAG based correction to the drafts.

Contraints:
1. The MTSs and QAs cannot copy and paste any part of the drafts.

Advantages:
Saves Time: Current feed-back loop is too long which can be much shorter. QA guys submits an error and wait for days to actually validate that the reported problem is resolved or not.
Better QA Coverage: QA Team can focus on more important errors and less on repetitive errors.
